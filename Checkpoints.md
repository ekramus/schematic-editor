# Introduction #

This page summarizes tasks for each checkpoint. The newest checkpoint is allways located on the top of the page.

# Checkpoint 27.5.2008 (Checkpoint 09) #
## Tasks ##
  * **remember alpha when creating**
  * **just the circle part of arc (new element)**

# Checkpoint 20.5.2008 (Checkpoint 08) #
## Tasks ##
  * **use units, not just pixels**

# Checkpoint 13.5.2008 (Checkpoint 07) #
## Tasks ##
  * **beziere curve fill strange behaviour (alpha not working)**
  * **correct select**
  * **enable continuous move transformation**
  * **correct control behaviour (only works in right-down direction for Ellipse)**
  * **implement control for all elements, where it is applicable (ellipse, arc, rectangle)**
  * **delete**
  * **isHit not correctly working for beziere**
  * **isHit not correctly working for rectangle**
  * **correct selection rectangle around selected element**
  * **remove element duplication when moving** (removed implementing isDisabled(), otherwise repainting of whole scene will be required)
  * **correct bounding box for group (also working with line width)**

# Checkpoint 6.5.2008 (Checkpoint 06) #
## Tasks ##
  * **correct arc - pie**
  * **correct arc - border only**
  * _transformation_

# Checkpoint 15.4.2008 (Checkpoint 04) #
## Tasks ##
  * code clean up
  * javadoc

# Checkpoint 1.4.2008 (moved to 8.4.2008) (Checkpoint 03) #
## Tasks ##
  1. _finalize parameters_:
    * thickness (add ISO metrics)
  1. select
    * _selection and manipulation with all elements_
    * **drop edit (select is enough) - edit will be used for control points precision editing**
  1. finalize elements (arc, **polygon**, triangle, circle)
    * **bezier curve with only one control point (possibility to end it)**
    * remove popup for poly's
  1. _add alpha channel_
  1. _add Ctrl for fixation of shape/angle_

# Checkpoint 25.3.2008 (Checkpoint 02) #
## Tasks ##
  * finish as much from last checkpoint, as possible

# Checkpoint 18.3.2008 (Checkpoint 01) #
## Tasks ##
  * elemens should be editable (**line width**, **colors**, description, alpha channel, position parameters)
  * _delete should work_
  * _add delta distance_ (fix point and show distance to pointer)
  * _all graphical elements should be implemented_
  * **properties dialog should be shown on the right side as toolbar**
  * move should work (**line**, ellipse, etc.)


Note: **bold** items were implemented in given checkpoint, _italic_ items were not.
